# DreamMachineTesting

This repository stores files resulting from testing the quality of the DreamMachine for polysomnographic experiments.

To assess the DreamMachine's quality a nap study was conducted where each participant's (n=10) EEG, EOG, EMG and ECG was recorded on two devices simultaneously, namely the DreamMachine and the SOMNO HD eco.

All three emails that were sent out to the participants of the experiment are documented in the folder called **Emails**.
The images which were used in the thesis are stored in **Figures**.
Some remarks noted during the process of the study are documented in the **Protocol.pdf**.
All three **Matlab Scripts** are stored in the correspondent folder.
All findings resulting from the comparison of the two devices are stored in **Graphoelements**, **PowerPlots** and **Spectrograms** folders and in **Details.xlsx** and **Traumemotionen_Schlafquali.ods** files.

The original measurement files as well as the recording files extracted from Matlab using ft_databrowser could not be attached online in this repository due to their large size.
These files can only be found on the supplementary USB drive, the original measurements are stored in the folder **Recordings**.
Those obtained by the SOMNO HD eco are in .edf format and all recordings resulting from the DreamMachine are .csv files.
The Matlab versions are saved to **Databrowser**.

All .fig files can only be accessed in Matlab (version R2022a is recommended).
To execute the Matlab scripts the Fieldtrip Toolbox needs to be installed (version released on January 25, 2023)

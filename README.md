# DreamMachineTesting

This repository stores files resulting from testing the quality of the DreamMachine for polysomnographic experiements.

To assess the DreamMachine's quality a nap study was conducted where each participant's (n=10) EEG, EOG, EMG and ECG was recorded on two devices simultaneously, namely the DreamMachine and the SOMNO HD eco.

All three emails that were sent out to the participants of the experiment are documented in the folder called **Emails**.
The images which were used in the thesis are stored in **Figures**.
Some remarks noted during the process of the study are documented in the **Protocol.pdf**.
All three **Matlab Scripts** are stored in the correspondent folder.
All findings resulting from the comparison of the two devices are stored in **Graphoelements**, **PowerPlots** and **Spectrograms** folders and in **Details.xlsx** and **Traumemotionen_Schlafquali.ods** files.

# DELTE this section
The folder **Databrowser** contains Matlab figures showing the EEG and EOG traces of all measurments in 200 30-sec trials.
The measurements are saved to **Recordings**. Those obtained by the SOMNO HD eco are in .edf format and all recordings resulting from the DreamMachine are .csv files.
# until here

All .fig files can only be accessed in Matlab (version R2022a is recommended).
To execute the Matlab scripts the Fieldtrip Toolbox needs to be installed (version released on January 25, 2023)
